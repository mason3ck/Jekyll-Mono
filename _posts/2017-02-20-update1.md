### February 20, 2017
Time for an update on what I'm doing!

I've realized the website is pretty awful, so I'm working on adding more images, color, and fixes!
Namely, I'm adding in these guys: ![Aren't they cute?](https://github.com/mason3ck/mason3ck.github.io/blob/master/images/notes/note-finger.png?raw=true "Aren't they cute?") They will help add some spice to the site by hanging around on the page, seeing how they are sticky notes and all...

I have also decided to add more tabs, such as a dedicated art tab, to help compile the "notes" as I call them, and other work.

Hopefully I can get the site into line before I decide to do these changes...

P.S. Images and ####[orange colored](like this) text can be hovered over for more commentary and information.
