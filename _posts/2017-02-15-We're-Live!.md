### February 15, 2017
Today is the launch of this website!![YAYcelebrations!](https://github.com/mason3ck/mason3ck.github.io/blob/master/images/notes/note-celebration.png?raw=true "YAY celebrations!")

 It also happens to be my birthday, which is pretty ironic.
I wanted to take the time to talk about the kind of content that will be posted here, by me, only me...

---

**Blog**
 In the Blog section you will see PSA's, posts about games I'm enjoying, jokes, updates on whatever I'm working on, maybe even some stories I find interesting enough to share.

**About**
 Do I really need to explain this? Well, actually this page will be a sort of resume, either if you want to compare yours, ~~hire me~~ or get a good sense of what one looks like

**Projects**
 A home for my work, all sorts of art, and things I've made can be found here, with a good general explanation of what it is, or tried to be. This page will be continuously changing, with newer projects pushing older ones down.

---

In the future I would like to add more tabs, as well as make these pages a bit more interesting. Happy reading!
