Welp, I'm awful at updating this! ![Hey I'm a busy person ok?](https://github.com/mason3ck/mason3ck.github.io/blob/master/images/notes/note-shrug.png?raw=true "Hey I'm a busy person ok?")

I guess I better fill you in on what's happened lately!
Recently I've been working on making on an assistive technologies project for my engineering class. I ended up choosing to make a more comfortable AND affordable crutch. You can see all the specifics on the project page.

I also want to unveil a website I made, after a couple years of html coding I can confidently say that I know what I'm doing finally! (I don't)
Just add in a [/mars](https://www.mason3ck.github.io/mars) in the top bar and you'll head on right over!
